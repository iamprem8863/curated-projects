# WEBPACK

`npm init` - this helps generate the `package.json` - it can be used to set up a new or existing npm package.

`npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev` - installs webpack to the node_modules directory of your project. Webpack is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.

`main.js` will be created by the webpack.

`npx webpack --watch` - to run the webpack.
