synchronous - means the code runs right now
Asynchronous - means the code will run later.(we use eventListeners so they know when to run)

## Javascript -is single-threaded

it means javascript can only do one thing at a time.

## javascript - is Non-Blocking

it means the javascript engine won't wait until something is finished, before moving on to the next line of code.

## javascript - concurrency

this is the process of interweaving many tasks, doing a little of one and then a little of another, engaging in this processes so quickly that it appears that they are running simultaneously.
