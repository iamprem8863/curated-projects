# JSON

when we make API calls, it returns data in form of `json`.
Json returns a key-value pairs.

## PARSING JSON

breaking down data to extract the data we want.
we need to save this json into a const variable.
then we can access the data in it using bracket notation or dot notation - just like we would access properties of other javascript objects.
for nested objects you will just keep on notating it using `.`.

Chaining dot notation in this way will allow us to access most of the properties in a JSON object.

## ACCESSING ARRAY KEYS

if an array exists in a json to access it you will need to use an index, with a mixture of dot notation.

## LOOPING THROUGH ARRAYS

we can loop through it just like we would any other array.
